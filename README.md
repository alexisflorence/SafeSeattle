# SafeSeattle

## Overview
SafeSeattle is a Java-based web application designed to provide users with safety information and resources in the Seattle area. This project combines a Java backend with a dynamic web frontend, offering an interactive and informative experience for its users. This was a collaborative group project done at Northeastern University. I have uploaded it to my personal GitHub Repo. 

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: View safety information on a map of Seattle.
- **Resources**: Access a list of safety resources and contacts.
- **User Contributions**: Users can submit their safety tips and experiences.
